# Spatial Systems Lab

A long-term research and engineering project focused on:

- Computational spatial mathematics
- Coordinate system transformations
- Large-world architecture
- Geospatial data integration
- XR infrastructure engineering

This repository contains executable artifacts.
Conceptual notes are maintained separately in Obsidian.
